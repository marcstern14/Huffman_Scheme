# Huffman_Scheme
This is a Huffman Encoding and Decoding Scheme I wrote in Python.

This project was done as part of a Data Structures in Python course at Montclair State University, as part of my MS in Data Science (completed Summer 2020).

Please find Huffman_Scheme.pdf file for full documentation.
All imported code is provided by the textbook, "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Michael T. Goodrich Roberto Tamassia Michael H. Goldwasser."
